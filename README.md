## Current Projects

Machine Learning for Predicting the Time Evolution of Supermassive Black Hole Binaries_ (Ongoing)

## Workshops

- International workshop on diffusions in machine learning: foundations, generative models, and optimisation, _participant_

## Research Interests

My astrophysical interests include: N-body simulations, Supermassive black holes and stochastic gravitational wave background. In tandem, I'm very much interested in SciML, and how it can be applied to astrophysics to build interpretable surrogate models from simulations. The current techniques that I'm particularly fond of are: Bayesian Deep Learning, Neural ODEs, Neural Operators, Flow matching and Symbolic Regression.

## Other Interests

- I've also enjoy experimenting with foundation models on HuggingFace. Recently experimented with RAG using [Cohere API](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/llamaindex) + [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) + [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/).
- I'm currently trying to pick up Julia so that I can use their [SciML](https://sciml.ai/) ecosystem.

## My Current Setup

- bash + [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) + [Starship](https://starship.rs/)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [essential Python extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python#_install-python-and-the-python-extension) for Python/ML projects
- Jupyter notebooks for experimenting in Python/Julia
- [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) for generating project templates
