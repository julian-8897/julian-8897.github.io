# Astrophysics/Machine Learning PhD Researcher

I'm a PhD student at the **University of Surrey**.  
I develop machine learning surrogate models to predict the dynamical evolution of astrophysical systems, with a focus on **supermassive binary black holes in galactic mergers**. My work combines **graph neural networks, neural ODEs, and symbolic regression** to build interpretable, scalable models for spatiotemporal systems.

## Technical Skills

- **Programming Languages**: Python, SQL
- **Machine Learning Frameworks**: PyTorch, PyTorch Lightning, PyTorch Geometric, scikit-learn, Pyro, Hugging Face Transformers
- **Scientific Computing & Data Handling**: pandas, NumPy, SciPy, h5py, Jupyter  
- **Workflow & Experimentation**: Git, Bash, Weights & Biases
