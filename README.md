### Current Projects 
_Bayesian Neural Networks for Predicting the Time Evolution of Supermassive Black Hole Binaries_ (Ongoing)

### Research Interests
My astrophysical interests include: N-body simulations, Supermassive black holes and stochastic gravitational wave background. In tandem, I'm very much interested in SciML, and how it can be applied to astrophysics to build interpretable surrogate models from simulations. The current techniques that I'm particularly fond of are: Bayesian Deep Learning, Physics-informed Neural Networks, Neural ODEs and Variational inference.

### Other Interests
- I've also enjoy experimenting with foundation models on HuggingFace. Recently experimented with RAG using [Claude API](https://www.anthropic.com/api) + [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) + [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/).
- I'm currently trying to pick up Julia so that I can use their [SciML](https://sciml.ai/) ecosystem. 

### My Current Setup
- bash + [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) + [Oh-My-Bash](https://ohmybash.nntoan.com/)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [essential Python extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python#_install-python-and-the-python-extension) for structured Python projects
- Jupyter notebooks for experimenting in Python/Julia
- [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) for generating project templates
- I tend to follow the [PEP 8 Style Guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) and the Zen of Python
