# Astrophysics/Machine Learning PhD Researcher

### Education
- PhD Astrophysics, University of Surrey (Sept 2023 - Current)

### Research Interests
My astrophysical interests include: N-body simulations, Supermassive black holes and stochastic gravitational wave background. In tandem, I'm very much interested in SciML, and how it can be applied to astrophysics to build and interpret surrogate models from simulations. The current techniques that I'm particularly fond of are: Bayesian Deep Learning, Physics-informed Neural Networks, Neural ODEs and Variational inference.

### My Current Setup
- bash + [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) + [Oh-My-Bash](https://ohmybash.nntoan.com/)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [essential Python extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python#_install-python-and-the-python-extension) for structured Python projects
- Jupyter notebooks for experimenting in Python/Julia
- [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) for generating project templates
- I tend to follow the [PEP 8 Style Guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) and the Zen of Python
